# rbrsa: An R Package for Turkish Banking Sector Data

An R package for programmatic access to Turkish banking sector data from
the Turkish Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA, known as
BDDK in Turkish). The package provides R users with a clean interface to
fetch monthly and quarterly banking statistics, financial reports, and
sectoral indicators directly from BRSA’s official APIs.

## Key Features

- Direct API access to BRSA monthly bulletins (17 financial tables)
- Quarterly Finturk data with city-level granularity (7 tables, 82
  cities including ‘HEPSİ’ for all cities)
- Consistent parameter interface for both data sources
- Built-in metadata for tables, banking groups, and cities
- Multiple export formats: RDS, CSV, Excel via
  [`save_data()`](https://obakis.github.io/rbrsa/reference/save_data.md)
- Returns base R data frames ready for analysis

## Design Philosophy

Unlike configuration-heavy approaches, such as
[bddkR](https://github.com/ozancanozdemir/bddkR) (which is a based on
[bddkdata](https://github.com/urazakgul/bddkdata), a Python package),
rbrsa uses a programmatic design that dynamically extracts column
structures from API responses while maintaining a stable user interface.
This approach reduces maintenance burden and adapts to BRSA API changes.

## Installation

You can install from CRAN

``` r
install.packages("rbrsa")
```

The development version can be installed from GitHub:

``` r
#install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("obakis/rbrsa")
```

## Getting started

rbrsa package retrieves tablesfrom two distinct publication portals
maintained by the Turkish Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency
(BDDK). Both portals are official sources, but they organize the data
differently: The [Monthly Bulletin
Portal](https://www.bddk.org.tr/bultenaylik) provides high-level,
summary reports designed for general consumption and quick overviews of
monthly trends without any geographic coverage. The [Finturk Data
System](https://www.bddk.org.tr/BultenFinturk/) provides granular,
detailed data, including statistics broken down by province, whereas the
standard Monthly Bulletin offers national-level aggregates.

Note: For the time being only a single grup_kod is allowed. The API
allows using multiple grup_kod as well to download for more than bank
groups. This will be added in future versions.

``` r
library(rbrsa)
## Explore available tables
list_tables("bddk") # list_tables("bddk","tr")
list_tables("finturk")  # list_tables("finturk", "tr")
list_groups("bddk")  
list_groups("bddk","tr")  
list_groups("finturk")

## Monthly data (Table 15: Ratios)
data <- fetch_bddk(2024, 1, 2024, 3, table_no = 15, grup_kod = 10001)

## Quarterly Finturk data
q_data <- fetch_finturk(2024, 3, 2024, 9, table_no = 1, grup_kod = 10007)

## Save results
temp_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".csv") # filenames is without extension
save_data(q_data, temp_file, format = "csv")
```
