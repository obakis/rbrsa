Description: 
    The goal of the 'rbrsa' package is to provide automated access to banking 
    sector data from the Turkish Banking Regulation and Supervision 
    Agency (BRSA, known as BDDK in Turkish). The package retrieves tables from 
    two distinct publication portals maintained by the BRSA: The Monthly 
    Bulletin Portal <https://www.bddk.org.tr/bultenaylik> and The FinTurk Data 
    System <https://www.bddk.org.tr/BultenFinturk>.
